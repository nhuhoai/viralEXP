# viralEXP
viralEXP is an R package used for estimating the concentrations of microorganisms based on endpoint dilution assays and Most Probable Number (MPN) statistics. This package includes a function for traditional MPN calculations for data from a single sample, but another function is available to extend the MPN model so that the output can subsequently be used in a log-linear regression, such as the calculation of the decay rate for microorganisms with respect to a disinfectant.
